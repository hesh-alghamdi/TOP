# Technical Documentation

This project is focused on layout and writing a documentation for a product of sorts.

I replacate [FCC documentation example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL) with some changes and tweaks.

It's required that I define a lot of elements and use them in a speicific way, but I could've done different in that regard. For example, making the navbar sticky to the top of the screen or use JS to make it collapsable.

This is just plain HTML and CSS.
